# Customer_Segmentation
### Introduction:

#### Objective:
The aim of this analysis is to perform customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering. The goal is to identify distinct groups within the customer based on their annual income and spending score. By clustering customers into different segments, we can better understand their behavior and tailor marketing strategies to each group.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Mall_Customers.csv," which contains information about customers of a shopping mall. The dataset consists of 200 rows and 5 columns. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Spending score assigned to the customer, ranging from 1 to 100.
